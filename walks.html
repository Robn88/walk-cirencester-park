                <li>Starting from the main gates of the park, walk in a straight line up the path. From there, the path splits into 3: continue walking straight ahead, until you reach the Polo Club, which will be on your right.</li>
                <li>Keep walking ahead, past the Polo club, and leaving the dirt track. At this point, the spire of Cirencester Parish Church should just be visible on the horizon directly behind you, and a pair of 18th century 'follies', pictured right, will be in front of you.</li>
                <li>The follies mark a good place to have a rest, if needed, as they mark the halfway point of the walk, and offer shelter from inclement weather.</li>
