            <ol>
                <li>Starting from the main gates of the park, walk in a straight line up the path. From there, the path
                    splits into 3: continue walking straight ahead, until you reach the Polo Club, which will be on your
                    right.</li>
                <li>Keep walking ahead, past the Polo club, and leaving the dirt track. At this point, the spire of
                    Cirencester Parish Church should just be visible on the horizon directly behind you, and a pair of
                    18th century 'follies', pictured right, will be in front of you.</li>
                <li>The follies mark a good place to have a rest, if needed, as they mark the halfway point of the walk,
                    and offer shelter from inclement weather.</li>
            </ol>

                <ol start="4">
                    <li>From here, continue walking straight ahead, with the follies directly behind you. The path will
                        start to narrow, and the grass will become longer, like in the photo to the left.</li>
                    <li>Eventually, you will arrive at a large clearing, where 8 different paths intersect. Take the
                        path between your right and straight ahead, which will be marked with an orange sign.</li>
                    <li>This path will lead you out of the woods, into fields, and then into the village of Sapperton
                        itself via Church Lane, where the Bell can be found easily. Have a seat, and treat yourself to a
                        pint of locally brewed ale!</li>
