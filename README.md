# Walk Cirencester Park

This website is designed for people who may wish to discover more about Cirencester Park, specifically with regards to walking in the park. It attempts to sell the park as a place to visit through the use of photos, and by vaunting its natural beauty.

## __UX__
* The design of the website has been imagined with the experience of the user first and foremost under consideration. A minimalist approach has been used, with clear use of headings to guide the user towards the appropriate content. There is a contrast between photos that occupy a lot of space, and smaller ones that are typically accompanied by text.

### __Colour Scheme__
* There are two main colours present in the website; a white (rgb(251, 250, 242);) which is used as the background for all pages, and a green (rgba(87, 100, 38, 0.54)), which used in the footers and text boxes. The green works well with many of the photos, which also have earthy, green colours, and the white offers contrast, without being too visually distracting.

### __Typography__
* The two main fonts used are [Urbanist](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Urbanist) and [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat). Urbanist is primarily used for the H1 elements, and Montserrat for extended areas of text. These fonts were chosen as they are easy to read, and their minimal look fits in well with the rest of the website.

    * This will make it easy for people navigate across the site

  __Footer__
  * This small section at the bottom of the page, which is repeated across the site, contains links to the main social media platforms.

__Walks Page Main Image__
  * The main image for this page is smaller than that of the main page so that the heading below is visible. Its goal is to further sell the park as a beautiful walking destination.

### __Features to be Implemented__

__Gallery__
  * A gallery would be a potential feature, allowing more opportunity to showcase the wealth of natural beauty located in the park.
  * It could also contain a feature to submit a photo taken in the park, to be featured on the gallery page.

__Embedded, Interactive Google Maps__
  * It could be useful to have Google Maps embedded below the walk description, with interactivity, for example by placing pins on the map and labelling them according to the stage of the walk they correspond to, as well as previewing a picture that matches the stage of the walk.

  ## __Technologies Used__
  * HTML was used to code the structure of the website, and CSS was used to style it. 
  * Balsamiq was used to create wireframes, to give a rough idea of how the website might look.
  * TinyPNG was an essential tool to reduce the size of photos, while at the same time maintaining resolution.
  *  The repository is hosted on GitHub, which allowed for version control.
  * Gitpod was the workspace used to code, and build the content of the website, which would then be committed to GitHub.
